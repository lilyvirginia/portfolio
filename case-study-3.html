          <p><b>Stated Problem</b></p>
        <p>StartEd is an education technology (EdTech) incubator at New York University (NYU) with about 30 local startups with 100 startups worldwide.</p>
        <p>The leaders of StartEd approached my team with a problem: 'Our Slack channel is disorganized and, because our biggest goal
          is to grow as an online community where members can help each other and get help, we need to find a way to create a better digital
          "Kanban" for our community.'</p>
        <p><b>Defining the Problem</b></p>
        <p>StartEd's communication issues extended well beyond the Slack channel and the stated problem: members were unclear in general on how
          to best take advantage of all the opportunities provided by the StartEd program.</p>

        <p>Because we were dealing with a complex organization of many different moving parts, my team and I knew

      needs and the client's needs simultaneously</p>

      <p>We dove into our research process and soon learned that we needed to use different methods than we would
        usually for a digital product.</p>

          <p>By speaking at length with our client and casually chatting with StartEd members who were physically at the StartEd incubator
          co-working space at NYU, my design partner Jeb Kampil and I were able to get the lay of the land. Here is how StartEd works:</a>

        </div>
        <div class="text-left margin-bottom-half container">
          <p>* StartEd receives partial assistance from NYU, and many of the mentors on staff and board members are also university faculty.</p>
          <p>* The rest of StartEd's funding comes from monthly membership fees as well as future equity in some startups.</p>
          <p>* There are 3 major types of StartEd members: on-site incubator members, on-site accelerator members, and off-site incubator members.</p>
          <p>* Within each category, members have a variety backgrounds: founders, developers, marketing, and business. </p>
          <p>* Incubator members pay a monthly fee to be a part of the StartEd community and have access to the on-site workspace, daily events/lectures, and slack channel.</p>
          <p>* Accelerator members must apply to the program and give StartEd equity in exchange. They take part in a rigorous on-site 3-month program with access to mentors, daily events, and slack channel.
          Their work culminates in presenting at the annual "NY EdTech Week" Conference that is also produced by a separate division within the StartEd staff team.</p>
          <p class="margin-bottom-half">* Off-site incubator members are the same as regular incubator members except that they must attend all events via Audio Conference. </p>

<p class="margin-bottom-half"><p>It was clear from our conversations that StartEd has a complex organizational structure, and that different classes of users would have complex and different kinds of needs.</p>
<p>Because of this, we decided to skip our original idea of conducting a quantitative survey and go straight to conducting in-depth user interviews so we could comprehensively understand each user's needs.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBtpj1UwPpQnrCNwV769GKakhjs_17gw5evg8g3HxLE/edit?usp=sharing">this script</a> as a guide, we conducted hour-long interviews with 7 different members. We
  took <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koTTXmvw0FUKWtGqAOq3z6TmWFTMiyyMpWbKLq2-H9I/edit?usp=sharing">extensive notes</a> and condensed the information into profiles of two top priority users:</p>

      <p><b>User Stories</b></p>
      <p>Because our client's goal was to grow their off-site membership we realized that we needed to prioritize the needs of off-site members first.</p>

      <p>From there, we created a highly detailed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ok2lk8YZbAjvj2w-j-Q8NdkvvBgYFjlNndJ1KPX6qU8/edit?usp=sharing">user stories document</a>
         to organize and prioritize the needs of all of the interviewees in order of importance as well as feasability. Here are a few of the user stories:</p>

    <p>While all of these needs were important, some of them required solutions that were outside the scope of the project. By identifying what was most important we decided the focus should be on creating:</p>
      <ol class="margin-bottom-quarter">
        <p><b>A) Network</b></p>
        <li>A better sense of emotional connection online.</li>
        <li>Easier ways to know who other members are (role, type of market, skills etc.).</li>
        <li>Protocols on how interact in the space and online.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol class="margin-bottom-quarter">
        <p><b>B) Information</b></p>
        <li>Ways for members to plan ahead better.</li>
        <li>Easier ways to find out information on slack and get questions answered.</li>
        <li>Less overwhelming forms of digital communication.</li>
      </ol>


      <p>These 6 problems were identified by prioritizing all our user stories. To see them all, go here:</p></br>

   </div>
   <p><b>User Flows</b></p>
   <p>Identifying that "effectively asking for help" was one of the biggest frustrations across the board, we visually drew out how the exact pathways
   a user would need to take to accomplish that goal through this user flow using both technological and non-technological options:</p>

      <p>Intrateam communication is common problem. However, because the client didn't want to invest a lot of money into the solution, my team and I had to think strategically about what solutions were
        not only already available, but also financially possible.</p>
        <p>Although we knew that a technological solution would not accomplish all the goals we needed, we started out at least seeing what technological solutions already existed.</p>

            <p><b>Slack</b></p>
          <p>Since StartEd was already using Slack and many members also use Slack for their other projects, it made sense to explore what kinds of plugins
            might work well with Slack. We also explored different ways to organize the Slack channel itself and see if that could be a part of the solution.</p>
            <p>However we found that most plugins that achieved what we needed only became truly effective at a paid level. Even Slack's functionality is limited
              until you become a paying subscriber. For StartEd that meant about $1,000/month.</p>
            <p><b>Simpplr</b></p>
            <p>Simpplr is one of many platforms that has all the functionality that StartEd could need, however also at about $1,000/month it became a non-solution.</p>
            <p><b>Donut<b></p>
            <p>Donut was one of our favorite finds; a free Slack plugin that randomly connects members within a Slack channel who have not been introduced yet for a coffee or skype date, it was a perfect
              solution to Off-site members' problem of needing more direct human communication.</p>

            <p><b>Options Conclusion</b></p>
            <p>After scouring the internet for other solutions, we realized that because of the financial constraints we couldn't rely solely on
              technology to fix the StartEd members problems, we needed a comprehensive, holistic approach.</p>

      <h5 id="recommendations" class="margin-bottom-half content-area">Design Thinking</h5>
      <p>StartEd already has in place all of the resources that their members are wanting. Their issue is not having what Don Norman would call "signifiers" - explanations, labels, guidelines etc.
        that tell the members how to access what they're looking for.</p>

        <p>Our job as UX consultants therefore was to suggest different ways that StartEd could provide better signifiers. We
          divided up our solutions into 4 broad categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="li-categories">Technological</li>
        <li class="li-categories">Programmatic</li>
        <li class="li-categories">Protocols</li>
        <li class="li-categories">Physical</li>
      </ul>

      <b>Technological</b>
      <p>In order to address problems 4, 5, and 6, we decided to reorganize the existing Slack channels by giving them clearer titles and definitions for what they could do.<p>
        <p>We came up with the titles for the Slack channels by conducting a card sort with 3 StartEd members:</p>

      <p>This card sort activity showed us that there were two different ways to organize the channels. We had the option of:</p>

      <p>1. Organizing by discussion topic. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Finance</li>
              <li>Legal</li>
              <li>Marketing</li>
              <li>Tech</li>
            </ul>
        <p>2. Organizing by actions. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask</li>
        <li>Offer</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
